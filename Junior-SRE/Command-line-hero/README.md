# 1. What is a shell 
```
When we speak of the command line, we
are really referring to the shell. The shell is
a program that takes keyboard commands
and passes them to the operating system to
carry out. Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell
program from the GNU Project called bash. The name
is an acronym for bourne-again shell, a reference to the
fact that bash is an enhanced replacement for sh, the
original Unix shell program written by Steve Bourne
